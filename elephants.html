                       <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                       <P>The African elephant is the largest living terrestrial mammal and is found predominantly in eastern, southern and western Africa in a variety of habitats. It has recently been recognised as two distinct species: the savannah elephant (Loxodonta africana) and forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), which are now categorised, respectively, as Endangered and Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.</P>
                     <p>Traditionally the major cause of the African elephantâ€™s decline has been poaching for ivory. While this still remains a threat, other issues caused by rapid human population growth have emerged. These include habitat loss, fragmentation and the development of agricultural land, which have all led to an increase in conflict between humans and elephants.</p>
